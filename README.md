# Pretty Printer

Pretty Printer is a tool for software developers to quickly visualize encoded
data. It supports Base64, JSON, JWT and Unix timestamp.

Although Pretty Printer runs in a browser, it is safe to use with sensitive data
as no data is sent to a server, or stored in the browser.

The official version is hosted at
[https://pp.mathieularose.com](https://pp.mathieularose.com), but you are
encouraged to self host it for extra security.
